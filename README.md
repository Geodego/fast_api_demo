# FastAPI demo

## Project description
Simple demo on some basic functionalities of fastAPI. This demo shows how to launch an API
using uvicorn and fastAPI.

## Requirements
packages requirements:

  - python~=3.8.12
  - fastapi~=0.75.0
  - requests~=2.27.1
  - uvicorn~=0.17.6

## Run the API

### 1st example main.py
To launch uvicorn:
```bash
> uvicorn main:app --reload   
```
the --reload flag allows us to make changes without restarting the server.

We can navigate to the url where we defined our get method and specify an item 42:
http://127.0.0.1:8000/items/42. We get the expected message
 {"fetch": "Fetched 1 of 42"}

Now we can go back t the url and specify how many of items 42 are fetched:
http://127.0.0.1:8000/items/42?count=5. We get the following message: "fetch":"Fetched 5 of 42"}

To run the post method defined in sample_request.py:
```bash
> python ./sample_request.py  
```

## Get the docs of the API
We can get the docs generated by fast API by navigating to the following url:
http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs

### 2nd example: main2.py
Simple script that creates a FastAPI app and defines a POST method that takes one path parameter, one query parameter,
and a request body containing a single field. To lanch this API:
```bash
> uvicorn main2:app --reload   
```
